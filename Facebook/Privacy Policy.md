What information do we collect?
===============================

The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our Products. For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you [even if you don't have an account\[3\]](#annotation-3).

Here's the information we collect:

Your activity and information you provide
-----------------------------------------

This and other information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could have special protections under the laws of your country.

Friends, followers and other connections
----------------------------------------

Information we collect about your friends, followers and other connections
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We collect information about friends, followers, groups, accounts, Facebook Pages and other users and communities you’re connected to and interact with. This includes how you interact with them across our Products and which ones you interact with the most.

Information we collect about contacts
-------------------------------------

We also collect your contacts’ information, such as their name and email address or phone number, if you choose to upload or import it from a device, like by syncing an address book.

If you don’t use Meta Products, or use them without an account, your information might still be collected. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/637205020878504) about how Meta uses contact information uploaded by account holders.

Information we collect or infer about you based on others’ activity
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We collect information about you based on others' activity. [See some examples\[10\]](#annotation-10).

We also infer things about you based on others' activity. For example:

*   We take into account whether your friends belong to a group when we suggest you join it.

We collect and receive information from and about the different [devices\[11\]](#annotation-11) you use and how you use them.

Device information we collect and receive includes:

*   The device and software you’re using, and other device characteristics. [See examples\[12\]](#annotation-12).

Information we collect if you use our Products but don’t have an account
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we collect:

*   Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, like Facebook Pages, videos and [rooms](https://www.facebook.com/help/211931886925431/)
*   Basic information about devices that downloaded our apps, like device model and OS

We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, like the Meta Pixel or Social Plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use Meta Products. Read our [Cookies Policy](https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies) to learn more.

Examples of why we collect information
--------------------------------------

### Security of our Products

For example, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to [scrape](https://www.facebook.com/help/463983701520800/?helpref=search) our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

### Safety and integrity

For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

### Advertising

For example, you may also see ads for the Meta Company Products shown through [Meta Audience Network](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768/?helpref=search) when you visit other apps if we can’t recognize you as a registered user of the Meta Products.

### Performance

For example, we use information we have about people who use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

4

Information you provide
-----------------------

For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

*   Create your avatar
*   Fill out a form
*   Contact us

5

Audio content you create
------------------------

You can create audio content, like if you're a host or speaker in a Live Audio Room. Live Audio can be listened to by anyone in the audience for the broadcast.

6

What we collect from our camera feature
---------------------------------------

![Three friends crowded together around a mobile phone, which one friend uses to take a selfie of them.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yl/r/QPopx9CyezA.png)

José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his friends. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature, including what he sees through the camera lens on his device while he’s using the feature. This helps us do things like suggest masks and filters that he might like.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
--------------------------------------------

![Three friends crowded together around a mobile phone, which one friend uses to take a selfie of them.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yl/r/QPopx9CyezA.png)

If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
-------------------------------------------

![A person using Ray-Ban Stories to take a photo of three friends posing on the beach.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yA/r/aNwNcF5iVhW.png)

Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on Ray-Ban Stories. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.

7

Metadata about content or messages
----------------------------------

Metadata is:

*   Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
*   Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

8

Apps and features you use, and how you use them
-----------------------------------------------

For example, we log:

We collect information when you use our Products to buy or sell things or make other financial transactions.

Some examples are:

*   Purchases within an online game
*   Donations to a friend’s fundraiser
*   Purchases in Marketplace, Shops or groups
*   Money transfers to friends and family (where available)

### What we collect from transactions

When you buy things or make other payments in Marketplace, Shops or groups, we collect information about your purchase or other financial transactions, like:

*   Credit or debit card number and other card information
*   Billing, shipping and contact details
*   Items you bought and how many
*   Other account and authentication information

### Why we collect this information

One reason we store this information is to allow you to access and view your payment and transaction history.

And you can use it the next time you shop to give you easier, faster shopping experiences.

The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use [manual review\[24\]](#annotation-24) to access and review your information.

To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information. We might also anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.

Here are the ways we use your information:

To provide, personalize and improve our Products
------------------------------------------------

We use information we have, including any [information with special protections](#1.subpage.1-YourActivityAndInformation) you choose to share, to provide and improve our Products.

We don’t use profile fields about religious views, political views or who you’re “interested in” to show you ads.

How we show ads and other sponsored or commercial content

We use location-related information that you allow us to receive if you turn on the Location Services device setting. This includes things like your GPS location and, depending on the operating system you're using, other [device signals\[27\]](#annotation-27).

We also receive and use [some location-related information](https://www.facebook.com/about/basics/manage-your-privacy/location) even if Location Services is turned off. This includes:

*   [IP addresses\[28\]](#annotation-28), which we use to estimate your general location. We can use IP addresses to estimate your specific location if it’s necessary to protect the safety and security of you or others.
*   Your and others' activity on our Products, like check-ins and events
*   Information you give us directly, like if you enter your current city on your profile, or provide your address in Marketplace

We use location-related information, such as your current location, where you live, the places you like to go and the businesses and people you're near, to do the things described in the “How do we use your information?” section of the Policy, like:

------------------------------------------

We research and innovate to help people around the world. Our goals include:

*   Contributing to social good and areas of public interest
*   Advancing technology
*   Improving safety, health and well-being

Here are some examples of our research:

*   [We analyze information](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/displacement-maps) about where groups of people go during crises. This helps relief organizations get aid to the right places.

Why and how we process your information

](#19-WhyAndHowWe)

22

Using information across our Products
-------------------------------------

We use [information across your accounts on our Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/373389520856284/) to:

*   Personalize ads for you and others. [Learn more](#2.subpage.2-HowWeShowAds).
*   Measure the performance of those ads. [Learn more](#2.subpage.10-ProvidingMeasurementAnalyticsAnd).
*   Provide more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products. [See examples\[32\]](#annotation-32).

23

Why we use information across devices
-------------------------------------

One reason we use your information across devices is to help us give you a more personalized experience. For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product. By combining that information across your devices, we can understand what ads are relevant to you and help businesses measure how well their ad performed.

24

Manual review
-------------

### Examples of when we use manual review

*   Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our [technology that detects violations](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Fenforcement%2Fdetecting-violations%2Ftechnology-detects-violations%2F).
*   When our algorithms detect that [someone might need help](https://www.facebook.com/safety/wellbeing/suicideprevention), a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
*   We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.

### Who reviews this information

Our reviewers work at Meta, for [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678?ref=tos) or for a trusted vendor. We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

[Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fpolicies%2Fimproving%2Fprioritizing-content-review%2F) about how Facebook prioritizes content for manual review.

25

How we personalize your Facebook Feed
-------------------------------------

Your Facebook Feed is unique to you. We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can [learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Ftransparency.fb.com%2Fen-gb%2Ffeatures%2Franking-and-content%2F) about the different types of signals we use to rank it. We also suggest content that’s relevant to you.

Many things influence the content you see in your Feed.

For example:

*   If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.
*   If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.
*   If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.
*   You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium. [Learn more](#2.subpage.6-HowWeUseLocation) about how we use location-related information.

Your activity on our Products
-----------------------------

![A cup of coffee, two donuts, and a hand holding a phone that shows an ad for a bakery.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yD/r/Th6exI59Xpt.png)

For example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries.

Your activity on websites and apps, depending on your settings
--------------------------------------------------------------

![An open shoebox, a new pair of shoes, and a hand holding a phone that shows an ad for shoes.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yf/r/qlPJB9FCb2w.png)

For example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store. The store shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.

If she doesn't want to see more ads from this shoe store, she can hide them in her [advertisers setting](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/advertisers). Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her [ad settings](https://www.facebook.com/adpreferences/ad_settings)

Topics we think you might be interested in
------------------------------------------

![A turntable, a laptop, headphones, and a pair of hands holding a phone that shows an ad for a music festival.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yQ/r/bD6aMOJt4ES.png)

For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Your connections
----------------

![An easel with a painting on it and a hand holding a phone that shows an ad for an art fair.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yi/r/Lx0r6R6-Ggu.png)

For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

27

Other device signals we receive
-------------------------------

We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

28

IP addresses
------------

IP address stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

29

Personalizing ads for you and others
------------------------------------

![A hand holding a mobile phone that shows a map of an airport.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yh/r/FhIjeJlzzmX.png)

For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ current location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

30

Helping to keep your account secure
-----------------------------------

For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.

31

Information we provide about different types of people
------------------------------------------------------

For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

32

Providing more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example we can:

*   Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
*   Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
*   Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products

33

Using your information if you set up your Accounts Center
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, if you follow your favorite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team’s Page on Facebook.

[Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/994989784595330/) about how we use information across accounts if you set up Accounts Center.

When you use an Integrated Partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------

Information they receive automatically
--------------------------------------

When you use an Integrated Partner’s products or services, they can access:

*   What you post or share from these products or services
*   What you use their services to do
*   Information from and about the device you’re using

[See examples\[37\]](#annotation-37) of when an Integrated Partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes these Integrated Partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

[Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.\[38\]](#annotation-38)

We automatically log when you receive a request from an Integrated Partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
-----------------------------------------

Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your data has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your [Apps and Websites settings](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/logging/?target=POLICY_PLATFORM_LINK_COLLECTION%3AMANAGE_APPS&element=privacy_policy_inline_text&containing_element_id=POLICY_SUBPAGE%3A3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmbasic.facebook.com%2Fprivacy%2Fpolicy%2Fprintable%2F%3Fback_id%3Dlink-collection-4%26link_dialog%3DMANAGE_APPS%26entry%3D0) from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else’s content on an Integrated Partner’s product or service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrated Partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the Integrated Partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How Integrated Partners handle your information
-----------------------------------------------

Integrated Partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information. In some cases, they use a separate service provider to receive and process your information.

Choosing an audience
--------------------

On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:

*   The public, including people on and off Facebook
*   Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag
*   A customized list of people
*   Yourself
*   The members of a single community, such as a group

On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a [private account](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F448523408565555), only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

### Audience settings are different from app permissions

Your audience settings are different from the permissions you give to individual apps and websites to access your information. [Read our policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn) about how you may share information with Integrated Partners.

35

Search engines
--------------

You can visit your [privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=privacy) to control whether search engines outside Facebook can link to your profile. But other public content–like if you post with your audience set to Public, or post on public Pages or accounts–might still be accessible through search engines, depending on the settings of that account.

36

Our Partners
------------

Businesses and people can use our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services. When they use our Products, we call them our Partners.

Our Products include our Business Tools and other technologies that allow businesses to advertise or support their products and services, or to understand and measure how people are using their services and how well their ads are working. For example, they might put one of our Business Tools, the Meta Pixel, on their website. Or they might use Meta Audience Network tools to monetize their apps by showing ads from businesses that advertise on Facebook.

Our Products also include technologies where you can make a connection to our Partners through our Products. For example, you might log into their app or website using Facebook Login. Or you might play their game on Facebook, which we call an integration because you can play without leaving our app. We call the Partners who use these integrated tools our Integrated Partners.

Here are some examples of our Partners:

*   Advertisers
*   Companies that measure how well ads are doing and provide reports
*   Businesses and people that use our Products to sell or offer goods and services
*   Publishers (like a website or app) and their business partners
*   App developers
*   Game developers

When an Integrated Partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

![Two friends playing a game on their mobile phones while a third watches them play and cheers.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yB/r/mMnLDuoxNfw.png)

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an Integrated Partner might receive your information
---------------------------------------------------------

![Hands using a tablet to tap the Like button on a news article.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yS/r/9luO5Rhdh6_.png)

Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your Like on their article.

38

Sharing friends lists
---------------------

### When you share your friends list

If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

*   They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
*   You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.

### When your friends share their friends list

Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

How do we share information with Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties?
========================================================================================

![A row of images, including a bar graph, two ads and an online shopping cart.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/uqoo1pq65u5.png)

We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require Partners and third parties to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
--------

Advertisers and Audience Network publishers
-------------------------------------------

### Advertisers

We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. [See an example\[39\]](#annotation-39).

Meta also provides advertisers and their business partners with information about:

*   Ads people engaged with, if any
*   When people engaged with ads
*   Where that ad was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)

But we don't share information with these advertisers and their business partners that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission.\[40\]](#annotation-40)

### Audience Network publishers and their business partners

Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on apps outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as business partners who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

*   How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
*   Information related to or in response to a [publisher’s request](https://www.facebook.com/help/119468292028768?ref=shareable) to serve an ad on its app.

But we don't share information with these publishers and their business partners that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you [give us permission\[40\]](#annotation-40).

Partners who use our analytics services
---------------------------------------

People rely on our Products, like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content and features.

We receive information about how people interact with their posts, listings, Facebook Pages, videos, Shops or other content, on and off our Products. Then we put this information into aggregate reports so they can see how well their content is performing.

These reports aggregate information like:

*   How many people interacted with their content
*   [The general demographics and interests\[39\]](#annotation-39) of the people who interacted with it

Partners who advertise with us also receive other information. [Read our policy](#4.subpage.2-AdvertisersAndAudienceNetwork) about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you choose to [make a transaction\[41\]](#annotation-41), or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or [commerce services platform\[42\]](#annotation-42), we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

*   Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
*   Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
*   Any information required by applicable regulation
*   Other information you choose to share with them

For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and shipping information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and billing address. [Learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/357872324807367/) about payments on Instagram.

Integrated Partners
-------------------

When you choose to use Integrated Partners’ products or services, they receive information about you and your activity. [Read the policy](#3.subpage.4-WhenYouUseAn).

Vendors
-------

Measurement and marketing vendors
---------------------------------

Measurement and marketing vendors are businesses that provide marketing-related support to Meta and its advertisers. For example, they purchase ads on our behalf, provide market research and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns. Such vendors also support our Partners' advertising.

Measurement vendors
-------------------

We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We work with measurement vendors who create reports that help our Partners, like advertisers, understand how their content and ads are performing, who is engaging with them and whether people took an action after seeing their ad.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our measurement vendors, who aggregate it to provide their reports. [See an example\[43\]](#annotation-43).

Marketing vendors
-----------------

We share information about you with companies that help market our Company and Products, measure the effectiveness of our own marketing campaigns and perform advertising research. For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with advertising vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests. [Learn more\[44\]](#annotation-44) about how vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts.

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers
-----------------

Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

*   Investigating suspicious activity
*   Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
*   Facilitating payments
*   Providing customer support
*   Improving the functionality of our Products
*   Providing technical infrastructure services
*   Analyzing how our Products are used
*   Conducting research and surveys
*   Marketing and promoting our Products
*   Analyzing the effectiveness of our ads

Third parties
-------------

External researchers
--------------------

We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

*   Our business or mission
*   Social good. [Learn more](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/).
*   Technological advancement
*   Safety and security on our Products
*   Public interest
*   Health and well-being

When sharing data with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. [Learn more](https://mbasic.facebook.com/privacy/policy/https%3A%2F%2Flm.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.fb.com%2Fdata%2F) about the privacy-safe research we support.

Other times we share with third parties
---------------------------------------

We also share information with third parties in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. [Read the policy](#10-HowDoWeRespond).

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, then we may give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, in line with applicable law.

39

General demographics and interests
----------------------------------

For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your [ad preferences](https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/) and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

*   Were women
*   Were between the ages of 25 and 34
*   Clicked on the ad from their phone

40

When you might give us permission
---------------------------------

For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information you provided.

41

Transactions you might make
---------------------------

*   Subscribing to premium content
*   Buying, selling or using products
*   Buying, selling or using services
*   Donating to charities

42

Commerce services platforms
---------------------------

Commerce services platforms provide a range of commerce services, including:

*   Payments
*   Marketing
*   Shipping
*   Customer engagement tools

43

How measurement vendors use information to make reports
-------------------------------------------------------

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

44

How vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts
---------------------------------------------------------

For example, vendors:

*   Serve our advertisements across the Internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
*   Track and categorize your online and mobile app activity
*   Provide us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions

These vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

How do the Meta Companies work together?
========================================

![A Portal, a Quest 2, and a mobile phone. The phone screen shows the Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram apps.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y4/r/R7g_daUH1j9.png)

We are part of the [Meta Companies](https://www.facebook.com/help/111814505650678) that provide Meta Company Products. [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400) include all the Meta Products covered by this Policy, plus other products like WhatsApp, Novi and more.

We share information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies. [Learn more](#9-HowDoWeTransfer) about how we transfer information to other countries.

We also process information that we receive about you from other Meta Companies, according to their terms and policies and as permitted by applicable law. In some cases, Meta acts as a service provider for other Meta Companies. We act on their behalf and in accordance with their instructions and terms.

Why we share across the Meta Companies
--------------------------------------

Meta Products share information with other Meta Companies:

*   To promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable laws
*   To personalize offers, ads and other sponsored or commercial content
*   To develop and provide features and integrations
*   To understand how people use and interact with Meta Company Products

[See some examples\[45\]](#annotation-45) of why we share.

Why we share across the Meta Companies
--------------------------------------

### Promoting safety, security and integrity and complying with applicable law

For example, we share information with Meta Companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. This includes:

*   Complying with their legal obligations
*   Helping keep you and others safe
*   Performing account verification
*   Investigating suspicious activities
*   Creating analytics

For these purposes, we might share your name, email address, who you’re friends with and other account information within the Meta Companies.

### Developing and providing features and integrations

For example, where available in your country, you can choose to use certain integrations that connect your WhatsApp experiences with other Meta Company Products. These integrations let you do things like:

*   Use your Facebook Pay account to pay for things on WhatsApp
*   Chat with your friends on other Meta Company Products, such as Portal, by connecting your WhatsApp account

We also share information with Meta Companies to support innovation. For example, your videos can help train our products to recognize objects, like trees, or activities, like when a dog chases a ball. This technology is used to help us offer new products or features in the future.

### Understanding how people use our products

We count the number of unique users, monthly active users and daily active users on our products. This information helps us understand the community using our products and publicly share important trends about how our products are used.

### How long does it take to delete your information?

If you request that we delete your account or content, it may take up to 90 days to delete your information after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. After the information is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.

If you leave your deleted content in your trash on Facebook or your Recently Deleted folder on Instagram, the deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process right away by deleting the content from your trash or Recently Deleted folder.

How long do we keep your information?
=====================================

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

*   If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. [Learn more\[48\]](#annotation-48).
*   The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. [Learn more\[49\]](#annotation-49).
*   How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. [See some examples\[50\]](#annotation-50).
*   If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products

In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. [Read our policy\[51\]](#annotation-51) about when we may preserve your information.

48

If we need it to operate or provide our Products
------------------------------------------------

For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your [activity log](https://www.facebook.com/0/allactivity) or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be [deleted\[52\]](#annotation-52).

But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the device you were using, or your location.

49

The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
-----------------------------------------------------

![A person at a birthday party, using a phone to send a message in vanish mode.](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yB/r/CFhhpKhcJqN.png)

For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s deleted after 14 days.

50

How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   A legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

51

Why we may preserve your information longer
-------------------------------------------

Your information, including financial transaction data related to purchases or money transfers made on our Products, may be preserved and accessed for a longer time period if it’s related to any of the following:

*   A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
*   A governmental investigation
*   An investigation of possible violations of our terms or policies
*   To prevent harm
*   For safety, security and integrity purposes
*   To protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
*   If it’s needed in relation to a legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings

[See some examples\[53\]](#annotation-53).

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

52

Delete your information or account
----------------------------------

To delete your information, you can:

*   **Find and delete specific information.** We offer tools you can use to delete certain information. For example, you can use Delete buttons to delete content you’ve posted to your account.

Examples of why we might preserve your information
--------------------------------------------------

### To respond to a legal request

For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

### To comply with applicable law

For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

### For safety, security and integrity purposes

For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

### For litigation

We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

Why is information transferred to other countries?
--------------------------------------------------

We share the [information we collect](#1-WhatInformationDoWe) globally, both internally across our offices and data centers, and externally with our Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties. Because Meta is global, with users, Partners and employees around the world, transfers are necessary for a variety of reasons, including:

*   So we can operate and provide the services stated in the terms of the Meta Product you’re using and this Policy. This includes allowing you to share information and connect with your family and friends around the globe.
*   So we can fix, analyze and improve our Products

Where is information transferred?
---------------------------------

Your information will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in:

*   Places we have infrastructure or data centers, including the United States, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden, among others
*   Countries where Meta Company Products are available
*   Other countries where our Partners, vendors, service providers and third parties are located outside of the country where you live, for purposes as described in this Policy

How do we safeguard your information?
-------------------------------------

We rely on [appropriate mechanisms\[54\]](#annotation-54) for international data transfers.

We also make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place whenever we transfer your information. For example, we encrypt your information when it’s in transit over public networks to protect it from unauthorized access.
