Ad settings

To show you better ads, we use data that advertisers and other partners provide us with about your activity off Facebook Company Products, including websites and apps. You can control whether we use this data to show you ads in your [ad settings](https://m.facebook.com/settings/ads/).

The Facebook Audience Network is a way for advertisers to show you ads in apps and websites off the [Facebook Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400). One of the ways Audience Network shows relevant ads is by using your ad preferences to determine which ads you may be interested in seeing. You can control this in your [ad settings](https://m.facebook.com/settings/ads/).

Ad preferences

You can use your ad preferences to learn why you're seeing a particular ad and control how we use information that we collect to show you ads.
